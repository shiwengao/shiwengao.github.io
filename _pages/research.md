### Job Market Paper

**“Influencer-Generated Organic Content and Firm Strategies” (with Wei Shi Lim)**<br>
*Preparing for journal submission*

Consumers are now increasingly relying on social media to discover new products and acquire information about product fit. Influencer-generated organic product review, as an independent source of product information, is playing an increasingly important role in consumers’ purchase decisions. We develop a game-theoretic model to examine whether and how influencer’s organic product review affects product awareness and the total product information available to consumers which further affects the firm’s advertising and pricing strategies, profit, and consumer surplus. Unlike previous literature, we do not study the influencer’s trade-off between organic and sponsored content but focus on the influencer’s organic content design, which allows us to incorporate the follower size of the influencer into the model, endogenize the firm’s pricing and advertising decisions, and consider a richer consumer heterogeneity (i.e., both in product knowledge and followership). We also discuss how the influencer’s content strategy changes with her follower size. We validate our model using YouTube data and our empirical results support our model prediction that the extent of information decreases with influencers’ follower size. Our findings complement the existing research on influencers and offer managerial implications for marketers and policymakers.
