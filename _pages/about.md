I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Marketing at the NUS Business School. I am on the Job Market this year. You can download my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My research is mainly focused on eWOM and digital marketing, but I also have a keen interest in doing research related to healthcare services and energy conservation.

I use different tools and methods in my research: game theory, causal inference, field experiment, and machine learning.
